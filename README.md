# About Me

I am a technically focused individual with experience in infrastructure engineering, software development, and privacy-first systems design. My work blends automation, documentation, and architectural clarity across hardware and software layers.

## Areas of Focus

- Infrastructure resilience using Proxmox, LXC, Docker, and ZFS
- Redundant access pipelines utilizing pfSense, WireGuard, and subnet routing
- Documentation frameworks inspired by S1000D principles for modular, traceable systems
- Custom control interfaces in React and Go for orchestration and observability
- Monitoring, fallback logic, and system-level recovery strategies for edge environments

## Current Projects

- Structured mount and backup orchestration for Samba networks
- Self-hosted monitoring tools for LAN integrity and anomaly detection
- Metadata engine for modular component mapping across infrastructure layers
- KVM-over-IP setup for remote BIOS management and zero-access recovery

## Philosophy

Infrastructure should be understandable, maintainable, and private by default. I build systems designed to withstand failure gracefully, document themselves intelligently, and operate securely outside of corporate constraints. Privacy and clarity aren’t options — they’re requirements.
