# About Me

I am a technically focused individual with experience in infrastructure engineering, software development, and privacy-first systems design. My work blends automation, documentation, and architectural clarity across hardware and software layers.

## Areas of Focus

- Infrastructure resilience using Proxmox, LXC, Docker, and ZFS
- Redundant access pipelines utilizing pfSense, WireGuard, and subnet routing
- Documentation frameworks inspired by S1000D principles for modular, traceable systems
- Custom control interfaces in React and Go for orchestration and observability
- Monitoring, fallback logic, and system-level recovery strategies for edge environments
- Selfhosting, privacy oriented services, secure access

## Current Projects

- Proxmox VE with mixture of LXC, Docker and VMs
- pfSense in VM as primary interface for network segmentation and trafic analysis
- Matrix server (Synapse)
- Documentation using Docmost
- Secure access using Wireguard, Tailscale and Cloudlfare Zero Trust, WAF
- DNS via TLS 1.2+ only
- VPN 24/7 with killswitch
- Grafana dashboards for monitoring
- HomeAssistant OS in VM
- Cron jobs for bash script backups
- Sutikata for active threat detection and alerts
- Leaks detection such as DNS, WebRTC
- DNS queryes auditing and strict policy against google and other spyware

## Philosophy

Infrastructure should be understandable, maintainable, and private by default. I build systems designed to withstand failure gracefully, document themselves intelligently, and operate securely outside of corporate constraints. Privacy and clarity aren’t options — they’re requirements.
